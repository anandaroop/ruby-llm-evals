    property :title, T.nilable(String), description: "The artwork's title. Preserve the original casing and formatting."

    property :price, T.nilable(String), description: 'The price of the artwork. It is assumed to be USD, and if so can be returned as a simple decimal number. But if there is another currency in the input, include it explicitly in the output. Examples: "420.42" for a USD price, or "420.42 EUR" for a Euro price.'

### CREATE A SYSTEM PROMPT THAT INCLUDES A JSON SCHEMA

SYSTEM_PROMPT = <<~PROMPT
  You are an expert in extracting and formatting artwork data.

  Your task is to read the provided CSV file and extract relevant artwork data into a structured JSON format.

  The output should be a JSON array of objects, where each object represents an individual artwork that conforms to the following schema:

  <ARTWORK_SCHEMA>

  #{JSON.pretty_generate(Artwork.json_schema)}

  </ARTWORK_SCHEMA>

  Observe the following rules when extracting data:

  - Extract **ALL rows up to 100** â€“ **NO EXCEPTIONS**
  - **Do not truncate** or provide "sample" output
  - Use proper Sentence and Title Case where appropriate. **Never ALL CAPS**.
PROMPT

### SOME CSV TO SUPPLY AS INPUT

# TEST_CSV = File.read("./files/granary-full.csv")
TEST_CSV = File.read("./files/granary-tiny.csv")

### CREATE A USER PROMPT THAT INCLUDES THE CSV TO BE PARSED

USER_PROMPT = <<~PROMPT
  Extract all artwork data from the attached file.

  Output valid json only, with no extra markdown, codefence or commentary.

  <FILE>

  #{TEST_CSV}

  </FILE>
